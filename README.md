# dog-identification-CNN

### Motivation of the project

This project aims to identify dog breeds from images using Convolutional Neural Networks so that I will gain experience in handling CNN algorithms and better grasp the concept. Throughout the project I employed 3 different CNN algorithms that are either fully or partially trained across the dataset provided by Udacity. If the image fed to the algorithm is recognized as a human or dog face, most resembling dog breed type is presented as the trained algorithmâ€™s prediction on what is shown in the image. If the algorithm does not recognize a human or a dog, it states so.

### Summary of the project

The project contains the following steps:

- A sub-algorithm for detecting human faces are created.
- A sub-algorithm for detecting dog faces are created.
- Own CNN algorithm is created for dog breed identification, trained using the dataset provided by Udacity.
- VGG16 CNN model is trained using transfer learning method for dog breed identification, trained using the dataset provided by Udacity.
- ResNET-50 CNN model is trained using transfer learning method for dog breed identification, trained using the dataset provided by Udacity.

### Summary of the results

The sub-algorithm called face detector used for detection of human faces was tested across 100 dog images and 100 human images with accuracy results listed below:

- Human faces detected in 100 human face images provided in ratio: 100%, therefore it has 100% accuracy.
- Human faces detected in 100 dog face images provided in ratio: 11%, therefore it has 89% accuracy.

The sub-algorithm called dog detector used for detection of dog faces was tested across 100 dog images and 100 human images with accuracy results listed below:

- Dog faces detected in 100 human face images provided in ratio: 0%, therefore it has 100% accuracy.
- Dog faces detected in 100 dog face images provided in ratio: 100%, therefore it has 100% accuracy.

Own model architecture has reached around 2.8% accuracy in correctly identifying the breed type of the test set of the dog images provided.

VGG16 model architecture has reached around 41.3% accuracy in correctly identifying the breed type of the test set of the dog images provided.

ResNET-50 model architecture has reached around 83.3% accuracy in correctly identifying the breed type of the test set of the dog images provided.
